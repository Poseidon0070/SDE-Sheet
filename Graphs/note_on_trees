// to find cycle in a tree we can use dfs ,
// use a visited matrix with
// 0 representing not visited node
// 1 representing currently processing node
// 2 already processing node
// just run a dfs and if a currently processed node it visited again by its neighbouring or children node 
// then this indicated presence of a cycle
// kahns algorithms gives a new intuition for dealing with tree problems with concept of indegrees
// we can also use kahns algo to find cycle in a tree

// to find loges diameter of a tree 
// finder a node farthest to a random node (say 0th node) in tree and then find farthest node to found node
// then distance between the tow is the diameter.
