1.) Find the Duplicate Number
slow fast pointer, floyd algorithm to detecct cycle in a linkedlist, tortoise method
convert array into linkedlist replresentation, proof of working
2 * slow = fast 
linkedlist representation is formed by taking index as elements of array 
to move each unit we nums[x], to move 2 unit nums[nums[x]]

2.) The problem requires us to sort an array of integers representing colors in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the 
colors in the order red, white, and blue. We are given that the colors red, white, and blue are represented by the integers 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
Dutch national flag algorithm
The idea behind the algorithm is to keep all the 0s before the low pointer, all the 2s after the high pointer, and all the 1s between the low and high
 pointers. The algorithm moves the mid pointer through the array, comparing the value at each position with 1. If the value is 0, the element is
  swapped with the element at the low pointer, and the low and mid pointers are incremented. If the value is 2, the element is swapped with 
  the element at the high pointer, and the high pointer is decremented. If the value is 1, the mid pointer is simply incremented.

The algorithm terminates when the mid pointer crosses the high pointer, indicating that all the elements have been processed and the array is sorted.

3.) Inplace sorting and remove repetition
Observation

4.) Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.
feel When all subarray type question is asked consider index till i and try to consider all subarray before it. in this way
we will consider all subarray at i = n-1

5.) Find all duplicated in a array
Modification and reverting method by summing elements with a large number
